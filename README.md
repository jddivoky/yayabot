# yayabot
This is just a fun bot I made for me and my friends :D.
Feel free to add it to your server.
## Basic use
yayabot isn't really a general purpose bot, it really just responds to certain triggers with memes, images, and gifs.
- To see said triggers, type `.help`.
- Also, yayabot does **not** support slash commands right now, I removed them due to too many issues.
- The prefix for yayabot is `.` (a period/full stop). Sorry for any conflicts this may cause. I had lots of problems with custom prefixes.
##### If you have any suggestions for unpopular prefixes that are still easy to type, let me know.
## Support/Suggestions
You can either DM me on discord ([`@theonetruenugget.`](https://discord.com/users/978055148091867157)), make a ticket in [the Discord server](https://discord.gg/kQZfrxeu6G), or add an issue to the Issues tab on the Github page (this one).
# Other notes
THERE ARE NO OTHER OFFICIAL YAYABOT WEBSITES OR CONTACT METHODS. ANY OTHERS YOU SEE ARE EITHER FAKE, OR REPRESENTING A DIFFERENT PRODUCT.
