# yayabot
This is just a fun bot I made for me and my friends :D.
Feel free to [add it to your server]((https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1376235848177025116)).

## Basic use
yayabot isn't really a general purpose bot, it really just responds to certain triggers with memes, images, and gifs.
- To see said triggers, type `.help`.
- Also, yayabot does **not** support slash commands right now, I removed them due to too many issues.
- The prefix for yayabot is `.` (a period/full stop). Sorry for any conflicts this may cause. I had lots of problems with custom prefixes.
##### If you have any suggestions for unpopular prefixes that are still easy to type, let me know.

## Support/Suggestions
There are a few different options for support. You can:
| Option | Is it viable? |
|--------|---------------|
| - add an issue to the [Issues tab](https://github.com/jddivoky/yaya-bot/issues) | ⭐️ best option |
| - make a ticket in [the Discord server](https://discord.gg/kQZfrxeu6G) | ✅ also great if you don't have a GitHub account |
| - create a post in the [Discussions tab](https://github.com/jddivoky/yayabot/discussions) | ⚠️ still good, but lower chance of me seeing it |

# Other notes
THERE ARE NO OTHER OFFICIAL YAYABOT WEBSITES OR CONTACT METHODS. ANY OTHERS YOU SEE ARE EITHER FAKE, OR REPRESENTING A DIFFERENT PRODUCT.
You can clone, fork, whatever to this code, so you can make it your own. All I ask is that you credit me for the work I did.
