# yayabot
This is just a fun bot I made for me and my friends :D.
Feel free to add it to your server.
## Basic use
yayabot isn't really a general purpose bot, it really just responds to certain triggers with memes, images, and gifs.
- To see said triggers, type `.help`.
- The prefix for yayabot is `.` (a period/full stop). Sorry for any conflicts this may cause. I had lots of problems with custom prefixes.
-# If you have any suggestions for unpopular prefixes that are still easy to type, let me know.
## Support/Suggestions
There is no support server, website, or command. If you need support or help, or have suggestions for things to add to the bot, please DM my Discord account (my username is `theonetruenugget.`), or add an issue to the Issues tab on the Github page (this one).
# Other notes
THERE ARE NO OTHER OFFICIAL YAYABOT WEBSITES OR CONTACT METHODS. ANY OTHERS YOU SEE ARE EITHER FAKE, OR REPRESENTING A DIFFERENT PRODUCT.
Again, if you have issues or concerns, feel free to DM me on Discord ([@theonetruenugget.](https://discord.com/users/978055148091867157)), or send an issue request [here](https://github.com/jddivoky/yaya-bot/issues).
